COVID-19, also known as Coronavirus Disease 2019, is a contagious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and quickly spread worldwide, leading to a pandemic. The symptoms of COVID-19 can vary but often include fever, fatigue, cough, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. The disease can range from mild to severe, with older people at higher risk of developing severe symptoms.

COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Preventive measures include physical distancing, wearing masks, hand hygiene, and vaccination. Several COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and distributed globally to help prevent the spread of the virus.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant social and economic disruptions worldwide, leading to lockdowns, travel restrictions, and other measures to control the spread of the virus. Despite the challenges, efforts are ongoing to combat the pandemic and protect public health.
